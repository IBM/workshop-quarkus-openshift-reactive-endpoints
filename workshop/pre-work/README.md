# Lab 1: Create your Cloud Environment

The main instructions of this workshop assume that you will use Red Hat OpenShift 4.3 on IBM Cloud. However you can also use [CodeReady Containers](https://github.com/code-ready/crc) to run OpenShift locally.

To use OpenShift on IBM Cloud and LogDNA in lab 8, an [IBM Cloud account](http://ibm.biz/nheidloff) is needed. It's free, doesn't expire and for the lite account no credit card is required.

We will use preconfigured [OpenShift on IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/kubernetes/catalog/openshiftcluster) clusters in this hands-on workshop.
