# Access the Cluster

In this section, you will login to your own IBM Cloud account, and then get access to a IBM Cloud Lab account which contains pre-provisioned clusters. Each workshop attendee will be granted access to one cluster.

## Step 1: Setting up your IBM Cloud ID

* Log into IBM Cloud with an existing account: <https://cloud.ibm.com>

OR

* Create your own: <http://ibm.biz/nheidloff>

## Step 2: Accessing the Cluster

Instructors will provide a URL to a web app. Enter your IBMid (the email you used to sign up) and the workshop key (also provided by the instructor).
